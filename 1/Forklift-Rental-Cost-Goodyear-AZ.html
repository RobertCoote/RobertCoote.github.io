Carefully consider lifting a brand new truck, as this can cause premature wear and added stress to critical components such as shocks, wheel bearings, suspension bushings, ball joints, and tie rods. When your load is sitting on pallets, the forklift prongs can fit easily into the pallet to move and carry your heavy load rapidly.</p>

Leveling Lift Kit: This is the most affordable kind of lift kit and is best for those who just want to look bigger on the road, because they only lift the front end and don't offer a significant enhancement to off-road trail performance.
