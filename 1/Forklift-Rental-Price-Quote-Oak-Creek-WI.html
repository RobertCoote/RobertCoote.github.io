<p>Stone does not offer what would officially be labeled as rough-terrain forklifts, but does have industrial lift products that can be used both indoors and outdoors. So, whether you are carrying heavy cargo or travelling with a large family, the conversion trucks at Turner Chevrolet are what you need. No matter what you are interested in, we have a dedicated customer service team that is ready to guide you through the process of acquiring the lifted vehicle you need.</p>
<p>Imagine the devastation of crashing with a semi-truck - that's the kind of damage you can expect from a lifted vehicle. Teletrucks, a new type of forklift, have an extending mast that is connected to a boom instead of a straight mast, giving them a wider range of motion. All rough terrain forklifts have a backrest that keeps the load in place. Ask the seller whether the forklift for sale is in usable condition, that the forks, mast, back rest, seat, chain and tires are undamaged, and if it has been involved in any accidents.</p>
