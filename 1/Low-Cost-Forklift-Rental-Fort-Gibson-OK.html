<p>Forklift is a small industrial vehicle, having a power operated forked platform attached at the front that can be raised and lowered for insertion under a cargo to lift or move it. Forklifts serve the needs of various industries including warehouses and other large storage facilities. We have uniquely positioned ourselves as a topmost enterprise, engaged in offering precision engineered Electrical Pallet Truck Truck. Even for shorter distances you need the performance of the transport truck, because the pallet trucks have to master many difficult situations in a short time: Narrow aisles, tight truck loading bays or steep ramps make goods receiving and transport difficult.</p>
<p>This range includes the quintessential Electric Pallet Trucks and Electric Platform Trucks, designed to enhance productivity, ensure safety and optimize returns. Powered by large, heavy lead-acid batteries, electric forklifts typically provide enough power for one standard eight-hour shift or about five to six hours of continuous use.

Four-wheel-drive is usually a selectable system designed to give better performance on broken terrain in low grip road conditions.
