Double-Deep trucks are similar, but with longer forks, making them perfect for areas where multiple pallet loads are stored in each bay as they will reach right to the back of the bay.</p>
<p>Also, the Entry Bar Safety Switch at the compartment opening on Crown's stand-up and counterbalance reach trucks slows the truck to a stop and sounds an alarm if operators attempt to drive the truck with part of their foot resting on the ledge.
