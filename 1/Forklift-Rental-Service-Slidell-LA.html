If the forklift truck in front is driving too slow. Handling processes will be slowed down, the equipment will experience increased wear and tear, and it may even suffer serious damage under excessive loads.</p>

If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
