Their lift trucks start at 2,500 lbs weight lifts and go upwards of 125,000.

Stockpickers are used at elevations higher than the second level of racking in a warehouse or distribution center.</p>
<p>This is critical because loads longer than 48” will reduce the rated lifting capacity of your rental forklift. Maintenance personnel may be lifted on the forks to reach their work. One major difference between a forklift and a car is stability. That's why we invest heavily in keeping our rental fleet in optimum condition.
