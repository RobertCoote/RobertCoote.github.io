If at any time a powered industrial truck is found to be in need of repair, defective, or in any way unsafe, the matter shall be reported immediately to the designated authority, and the truck shall be taken out of service until it has been restored to safe operating condition.</p>
<p>Fellow truck owners in your area may be able to offer additional advice about the best way to find a good deal on making your own lifted truck. Unfortunately, not every company has the budget to purchase brand-new forklifts. Our range of Rough Terrain Pallet Truck is scientifically designed to achieve maximum production capacity with minimum human efforts.

<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, an empty truck with the forks elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck in standing is tilted to the slope specified in Graph E.
