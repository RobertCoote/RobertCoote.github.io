<h3>Forklift Uses Midland TX</h3>
<p>We carry new and used forklifts in every major make and model. Our Fork Lift Rental fleet is regularly updated with New Rental Equipment and maintained according to manufacturer's specifications. There are plenty of lift kits available in the market that differ in terms of how much they can raise your pickup. Three-wheel forklift trucks also have models where the operator can either sit down or just stand while operating the truck.</p>
<p>Owning your own fleet of forklifts means you need to spend time and money maintaining them. Four fixed-fork order pickers are ideally suited for picking bulky, oversized items or where extended platforms and industrial carts are used in place of pallets. Rentals often have service and repair costs built into that monthly payment. Built for demanding use, this pallet jack is constructed from all-welded steel components.</p>

The hydraulic forks spread up to 2.22 metres gives excellent possibilities to handle long loads such as steel beams and plastic pipes but also conventional pallets. At Cat® Lift Trucks we design and build counterbalance forklift trucks for every application.</p>
