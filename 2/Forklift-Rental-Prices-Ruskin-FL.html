<h3>Forklift Truck Used Ruskin FL</h3>
<p>With greater ground clearance, a counterbalance forklift is certainly the better choice for uneven surface or outside work. Industrial counterbalance lift trucks are deadly - more than one hundred workers die and thousands are injured every year as a result of these powerful machines. Rough-terrain forklifts offer great versatility and are often called to fill a niche application.</p>
<p>A lifted truck also has a higher resale value because of how valuable these trucks are. We have used lifted trucks in stock from time-to-time, but we cannot guarantee availability on pre-owned models due to frequent changes in our inventory. As a result, customers should contact our team with questions about these suspension lift kits. The taller tires get the differential higher off the ground, reducing the risk of damage from obstacles, and all four wheels gain maximum traction due to the lifted suspension.</p>
<p>Five new forklift models - with load capacities from 1.4 - 2.5 tons - deliver class-leading performance, and lift heights up to 13 metres. Counterbalance forklift trucks are majorly preferred for use in applications where space is limited due to their effective maneuverability. A body lift increases the truck's ride height without changing the suspension, making them a good choice for light off-roading and adding a touch of style.</p>
