<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>Adding a Pro Comp lift kit to your vehicle will help to maintain vehicle ride height, reduce the effect of shock forces, maintain wheel alignment, support loaded weight, and control the direction of travel for your truck or SUV. Often called a tugger,” these versatile machines are most commonly used for pulling loads from Point A to Point B rather than lifting.</p>

Whether you need to lease for a day, purchase new lift truck equipment, or want to talk about expanding the capabilities of your current equipment, we can walk you through your options.

For example, a common system would involve a pallet truck feeding a reach truck in a unit load storage application, while the reach truck provides let-down for the pallet truck in low-level order picking.

<h2>Electric Fork Truck Berlin</h2>
<p>Besides the most experienced order picker training, we also offer other top quality workplace training services for businesses and individuals including forklift training , RF scanning courses , onsite training and refresher courses for businesses who want to up-skill or refresh their order picker operator's practical skills. Lifts come with a maximum lift height of 22 ft. and a ground level lift capacity of 8,000 lb.</p>
<p>It should be noted that you can equip your forklift with a camera to provide a pallet POV improve that view, though ask yourself this: Would you rather watch a football game on the 50-yard line, or on a 15-in. Designed by CASE, Load Control automatically provides on-the-go mast cushioning that lessens load shock when traveling over uneven terrain. A big lifted truck looks rugged and will surely turn some heads, but there are good practical applications to lifting truck aside from making it look good.</p>
<p>United Rentals was founded in 1997 and is the largest equipment rental company in the world. Items such as computers, drums, corrugated boxes, plastic bottles, furniture and beverages are examples of products which are stacked onto pallets and moved by reach trucks.

Large tires and elevated suspension equal higher ground clearance and mean these trucks are better able to handle all kinds of road conditions. Counterbalanced Stackers contain no outriggers and loads (1,500 - 4,000 lbs) are counterbalanced using the overall length of the unit, plus battery weight.</p>
<p>In the event of a crash with a lifted truck, the injuries can be extensive. Furthermore, training enables an operator to operate the equipment in a safe manner, which reduces potential accidents. The convenience of forklifts grew so much so that a great many used indoor lifts can be found in farms today. Contact your local MCFA forklift dealer to learn about your rental options.</p>
