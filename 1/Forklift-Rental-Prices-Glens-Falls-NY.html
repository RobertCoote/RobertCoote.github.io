<p>Trucks Only has a great inventory full of lifted trucks to browse through. So we have, on the one hand, electric forklifts and, on the other, internal combustion. Automatic parking brake, electronic speed control and braking system provide enhanced driver safety and also contribute to the BT Pro Lifter's long operating life and low lifetime cost. Heavier loads shift the center of gravity forward even further.</p>
<p>Trucks employing a horizontal (vertical axis) handwheel have been built with directional-reverse steer (i.e. a control that causes a truck to turn to the operator's right on clockwise rotation of the steering handwheel when the operator is facing away from the direction of normal forward travel.) For this reason directional-reverse steer is permissible for this type of truck.</p>
