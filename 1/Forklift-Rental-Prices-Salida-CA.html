Known also as forklift truck, fork truck or forklift, it was developed in the early 20th century. There are three main types of class 7 rough terrain forklifts, and all are designed a little differently for varying purposes. Eliminate your parts and service departments - If you currently own your fleet and maintain it you need mechanics, tools and parts.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
