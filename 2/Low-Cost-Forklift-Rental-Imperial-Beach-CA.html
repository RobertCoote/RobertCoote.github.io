<p>Specifically engineered for the unique challenges of a narrow-aisle warehouse environment, the Crown RR 5700 features the industry's first traction control system, enhanced execution of load-handling functions, and the fastest lift and travel speeds among other available reach trucks. With Crown's Stability Stance, operators have four points of solid contact with the lift truck when stopping and starting from 30 feet in the air. Backed by our proven support network, Crown's internal combustion forklifts are ready to handle the tough assignments. Our exclusive lifted models make these professional-grade trucks even more impressive and capable.</p>

Pallet jacks - also called order pickers, typical pallet jacks can lift approximately 3,300 pounds. Dayton® pallet trucks feature a cushion grip with a 3-position lever and a flow valve for controlled lowering.</p>
