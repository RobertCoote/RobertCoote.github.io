<p>This is the most common type of forklift driver, so once you have your licence you will be a highly employable candidate in the transport and logistics industry. Reliable Toyota Industrial engines offer faster acceleration and lift speeds, increasing productivity during stacking, loading and unloading goods, as well as horizontal transport functions. These forklifts are different from ordinary industrial forklifts, as they are extra-strong and rugged vehicles, that look a little bit like a tractor.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
