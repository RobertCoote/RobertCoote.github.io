Designed by CASE, Load Control automatically provides on-the-go mast cushioning that lessens load shock when traveling over uneven terrain. A big lifted truck looks rugged and will surely turn some heads, but there are good practical applications to lifting truck aside from making it look good.</p>

Browse Order Picker Truck Equipment. The Mast is capable of rotating 90 degrees, and the forks can then advance like on a reach mechanism, to pick full pallets weighing 3,000 - 6,000lbs.</p>
