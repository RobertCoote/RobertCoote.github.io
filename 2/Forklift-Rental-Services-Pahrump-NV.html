It is the highest capacity stockpicker in the line, handling heavy palletized loads at heights up to 366 inches.

<h2>Forklift Rental Service Pahrump </h2>
<p>At Ahern Rentals, we have the rental equipment that you need for your next project. Standup forklifts are "step in step out" minimizing the amount of time an operator spends mounting the truck.

This is highlighted by the impressive load capacity: Our low-level order pickers, for instance, can lift up to three pallets weighing up to 2.5 tons with their 2.4 metre long forks. The forklift training material fit our training needs nicely. They are more maneuverable and need less space to operate than sit-down forklifts.</p>
