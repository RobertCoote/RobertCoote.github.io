The durability and reliability of these reach trucks will help in minimize your truck downtime and total cost of ownership. The lift handle is attached to an electrical air pump at the base of the forklift.</p>
<p>Drive the forklift forwards and backwards and in a figure eight pattern, stopping and starting in order to test the responsiveness of steering and braking.

Our team of engineers developed our EWRS-RTF series of jcb rough terrain forklift tires to be easily repaired if damaged, although we are not sure you will need to with the quality that went into our design and components.
