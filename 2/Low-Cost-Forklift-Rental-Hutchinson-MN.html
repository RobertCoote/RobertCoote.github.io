<p>Rough terrain forklifts might look like they can only tackle one type of job. These are nice Crown order picker lift trucks with low hours and in good working order. For individuals who do exclusively on-road driving and no hauling, the only noticeable benefit is the lifted line of sight and boosted aesthetic. Because of the high initial cost, almost all forklifts are either rented or financed.</p>
