<p>Toyota Forklift is proud to have the biggest range of forklifts and battery-electric warehouse equipment available in South-Africa, ensuring that whatever your requirements we have a suitable material handling solution. This amount also plays a key factor in the vehicle's stability — a forklift that carries too much weight isn't stable. Layman's Terms: This is a commonly used suspension lift component that does raise the truck, but doesn't add extra ground clearance for the underbelly.
