<h3>Forklift Store Batesville IN</h3>
<p>Short-term requirements - If you only use the equipment to smooth out business operations during busy months or for a limited period, buying a forklift might be too costly. If you already have one of our electric forklift trucks, it can be easily retrofitted with lithium-ion power. They are also sometimes referred to as pallet trucks, pallet pumps, and pump trucks.</p>
<p>The forklift is every bit as good as they said it would be. I highly recommend this company.

The increased ground clearance reduces the risk of you damaging the underbelly of your vehicle.</p>
