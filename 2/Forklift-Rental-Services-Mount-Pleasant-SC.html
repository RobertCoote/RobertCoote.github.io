<p>In terms of their use, apart from being very fast, counterbalanced forklifts are ideal for working both inside and outside the warehouse. The larger ground clearance allows you to install larger tires and perhaps the best part of all is that your truck will handle the same or better than it did before depending on the type of kit you install. If you are driving aggressively in a lifted vehicle, it is a lot easier to spot the infraction and track your lifted truck down.</p>
<p>Every year nearly 100 workers are killed and 20,000 are seriously injured in forklift mishaps. Telescopic forward reach allows you to unload lorries from one side so no forklift movement around the other side of the lorry is required, ensuring pedestrians stay safe and separate. The reach forklift is a warehouse truck used mainly for indoor work. Lifted trucks from respected companies like Rocky Ridge are the best option since they have experience and numerous positive reviews.</p>
