<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>Forklift Rentals - Our fully stocked rental department can deliver equipment next day for short or long term rentals. That's why Linde Material Handling uses trucks with a modular design for its picking devices, in order to help to minimize physical strain on the driver and increase the efficiency of the picking process in any working environment. We understand that downtime is a killer in any material handling business, and we promise to get your equipment up and running as quickly as possible.</p>
