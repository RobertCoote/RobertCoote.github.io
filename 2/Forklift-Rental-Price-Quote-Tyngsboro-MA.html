Sit-down Forklift and Rider Pallet Jack experience is helpful. Workplace type and conditions are also factors in hazards commonly associated with powered industrial trucks. Place empty truck on an initially level platform in a position such that the centerline of the truck is perpendicular to the axis of tilting of the platform, and with the rear wheels placed in their least stable position.</p>
