This is a unique walkie counterbalance truck which was designed to operate in a large chemical manufacturing facility.

Like the base model 3-wheel forklift, the basic 4-wheel capacity is 3,000 lb. But the difference between the two types of trucks is that 4-wheels don't quite have the maneuverability of 3-wheels.</p>
