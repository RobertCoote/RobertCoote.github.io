Ask your Raymond Handling Concepts Sales Rep about new, used or rental availability of order pickers.</p>

<p>There is nothing like the ride that is achieved from air suspension. The order picker forklift has a small platform big enough for the operator to stand behind the forks with controls for operating the forks. Suspension lift kits can raise a truck a full foot from where it started, and they aren't just lifting up the truck's body and putting it back again. Counterbalanced and noncounterbalanced Fork Lift Trucks and Reach Trucks — The maximum weight; expressed in pounds, of a 48 inches homogeneous cube (24 inches load center) that a truck can transport and stack to a height established by the manufacturer.</p>

<p>Load and unload pallets on and off trucks. I used to say, If it has forks on it and you're lifting up pallets, it's covered by the forklift standard.” But that's not 100% true anymore. Raymond counterbalanced sit down forklift trucks can use specialized load handling attachments such as slip sheets, and carton clamps. It is therefore essential to know the exact capacity and safety features of the specific forklift you are handling.</p>
