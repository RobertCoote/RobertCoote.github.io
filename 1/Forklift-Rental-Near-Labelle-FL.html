They work closely with independently-owned equipment rental yards, bringing everything together in one place.</p>

This involves driving the pallet jack throughout the warehouse, collecting different products on the order sheet, and safely getting out of the warehouse to load the orders onto a truck or other shipping vehicle.</p>
