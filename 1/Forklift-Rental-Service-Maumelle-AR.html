H&E were founded in 1961 and have been providing equipment rental for more than 50 years.

<p>Telehandlers are four-wheel drive trucks with long attachments with forks in the end for lifting pallets and other equipment. Our range of second hand order pickers make for faster, more accurate order picking.
