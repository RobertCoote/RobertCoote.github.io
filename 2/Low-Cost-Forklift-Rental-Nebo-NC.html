<p>Order picking trucks have a working platform that helps the operator to control the lift. Rating Plate: This is used to inform users of the maximum load a forklift can legally carry. This perk makes rough terrain forklifts ideal for busy construction sites with limited space. With FLC's counterbalance forklift certification, you're covered in case of an accident.

This will help determine the capacity of the forklift you need to rent.</p>

<p>In the case of forklifts, safe practices must be practised such as having an overhead guard that protects the operator from the accidental falling of objects which could happen whilst loading the forklift.
