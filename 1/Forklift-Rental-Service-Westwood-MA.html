It is the highest capacity stockpicker in the line, handling heavy palletized loads at heights up to 366 inches. You may also wish to consult with a custom truck body modifications expert for advice as to which types of vehicles will best meet your individual needs as well. This is why the aftermarket hardware can range from a minor lift kit to a comprehensive decked out vehicle.</p>
<p>Outfit your shop with confidence, knowing that Gray jacks and Gray lifts are some of the best jacking and lifting products on the market and backed not only by a manufacturer lifetime warranty but also quick and convenient repairs from Ohio Power Tool. A suspension lift is a more popular option and gives you more ground clearance than a body lift - it's the only way to get enough height for larger tires.</p>
<h2>Forklift Truck Safety in - Never Lose Focus  Westwood </h2>
<p>With high ground clearance and durable super-elastic wheels, these forklifts are ideal for working in indoor and outdoor environments. Rough terrain forklifts have the build and rugged construction to handle tough outdoor work. Due to their variety in fueling, size and either a four or three wheel design, counterbalance forklifts are arguably the more versatile of the two trucks.</p>
<p>A wide range of options allows you to adapt our order pickers to your own individual logistics profile. Sit-down forklifts come in 3-wheel and 4-wheel models. We'll make an offer on lift trucks in any condition. We are specialists in quality forklift equipment, forklift sales, forklift rentals, and on-site repairs of forklifts.

Sun Equipment has over 20 years of experience servicing the used forklift industry and is owned and operated by one the most respected men in the industry, Mr. Michael Hoskins… Mike as his friends and loyal customers call him.</p>
<h2>Lifted Trucks Westwood</h2>
<p>Moving Materials: With a rough terrain forklift, moving materials around a job site is easy. The following tests are designed to verify rated capacities of counterbalanced trucks having rated capacities up to and including 20,000 lb at 24 inches load center and to determine capacity or alternate rated capacity. Radically lifted trucks are just another way to separate fools from their money.</p>
<p>At Thompson Machinery, we've invested in a fleet of Cat forklifts, so you don't have to. Simply let us know when you need your forklift and for how long. Lifted trucks draw attention from everyone on the road and act as giant billboards at local shows, putting that paintjob high up in the sky for everyone to see. Electric forklifts are suited for indoor use and have several advantages.</p>
<p>Drive the forklift forwards and backwards and in a figure eight pattern, stopping and starting in order to test the responsiveness of steering and braking. They are smaller than most forklifts and so are able to manoeuvre in those hard-to-reach areas. Forget parking garages, and height clearance could become an issue in some drive thrus. With breakthrough lift heights, capacities, visibility and energy savings, the Crown family of reach trucks can help you move and store materials efficiently.</p>
<p>For example, a forklift with a 10,000-pound (4,540 kg) lift capacity is limited to a maximum lift height of 20 feet (6 m) and a maximum forward reach of 8 feet (2 m) when lifting a full 10,000-pound load. If you are looking for a forklift dealer in northern and central Ohio, visit Mid-Ohio Forklifts. Before installing any attachment contact your local authorized dealer of your forklift brand and ask them to begin re-rating your lift according to the attachment you want to install.</p>
