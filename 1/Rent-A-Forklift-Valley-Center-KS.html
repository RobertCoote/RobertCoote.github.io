A lifted truck with a higher center of gravity is not going to handle the way a stock truck with a lower center of gravity is. Forget tight turns and swift maneuvering on a lifted truck. Improperly installed lift kits will make for a rougher ride at best, and will be a tremendous safety hazard at worst. Designed for heavy loads, high reach, and extreme maneuverability, a forklift can make quick work of moving, loading, storing and unloading all sorts of loads.</p>
<p>The following particularly applies to pallet trucks with a platform: Many ergonomic elements and functions make it easier to operate the truck. Electric models offer a substantially lower cost per hour-of-operation than any of the internal combustion lifts.

As rental rates can be assessed differently, spelling out the time period can save you money by getting reduced long-term rates or reducing the term of your rental to the tightest possible time period.</p>
