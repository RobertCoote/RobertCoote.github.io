At the trucks' heart is advanced AC drive technology, which combines improved torque, efficiency and control with minimal maintenance needs.</p>
<p>Be sure the load is centered and the forks are completely under the load before lifting. Use these machines to tackle residential or commercial landscaping jobs. 2. Three-Wheel Counterbalance - These forklifts feature three wheels as opposed to four in their counterbalance forerunners. Compare that to any other body style of any car or truck from the ‘90s and it looks outdated and ugly.</p>

Most rented forklifts include a full maintenance package that covers all consumables, repairs, etc. No matter what type of project, we'll find the forklift that's best suited to your needs.

Most trucks on the market today are built with what is commonly referred to as a body-on-frame design; the frame is built for the engine, drivetrain, and suspension, then a separate body is attached to the frame.</p>
<p>The following are examples of Class IV powered industrial trucks. Semi-experience operator training - A slightly rare form of training, this is useful for those who have learnt to drive forklifts elsewhere, such as in a garden or other private property, but don't have formal training.
