In 2018, the Chinese market maintained rapid growth, with the fork sales outnumbering 500,000 units in the first ten months of 2018 and expectedly approaching 600,000 units throughout the year.

If you are an avid off-roader, then the benefit of higher clearance will probably outweigh the drawbacks.</p>
